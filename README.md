# Particle Simulation Using Bevy 0.11.3
This code iterates on what was done by Logic Project's work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgi9MT60QYw).

My changes are mainly to move the particles code into a reusable plugin that was broken into submodules for easy re-use and modification. 

I have specifically made this initial version of the project create a confetti effect, but I plan to expand this to fit my needs with future projects as well. 

## Planned Updates
[ ] More Spawner RON's to work with in an example folder
[ ] Configuration upon events about direction and initial location of particles
